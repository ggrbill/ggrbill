# Hi there 👋, I'm Gustavo G. Ribeiro!

I'm a Scientific Developer passionate about Numerical Methods applied to Thermal Engineering, which include fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, and heat transfer. 

I have a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering in which I worked with the Finite Volume Method applied to poroelasticity problems (Geomechanics of Petroleum Reservoir).

## About me

- 🔭 I’m currently working at [ESSS](https://github.com/ESSS?type=source) as a Scientific Developer. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Uncertainty Quantification of numerical models.
- :droplet:    I'm interested in Scientific Programming applied to Oil & Gas Industry.
- :man_technologist: I enjoy programming mainly in C/C++ and Python. However, I like to learn any programming language.
- ⚡ Fun facts: 
  - :vulcan_salute: I love Science Fiction such as Star Wars, Star Trek, The Matrix, and Back to The Future.
