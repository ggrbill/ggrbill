# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Gustavo G. Ribeiro!

I'm a Scientific Developer passionate about Numerical Methods applied to Thermal Engineering, which include fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, and heat transfer. 

I have a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering in which I worked with the Finite Volume Method applied to poroelasticity problems (Geomechanics of Petroleum Reservoir).
